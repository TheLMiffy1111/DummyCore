		//Using of ASM needs to follow simple lines
		
		//1. PARSER of the .class file MUST be called first. Will analyze the .class
		
		//Lookup the DCASMManager:
		/*
		    ClassNode classNode = new ClassNode();
			ClassReader classReader = new ClassReader(basicClass); <---- Here it is
			classReader.accept(classNode, 0); <---- CALLING the parser
			...
		 */
		
		//2. Event Producer(for CORE ASM type(we are using a TREE, which is built over CORE))
		
		//It is usually combined with the PARSER for the TREE.
		//Lookup the DCASMManager:
		/*
		    ...
			ClassReader classReader = new ClassReader(basicClass); <---- Here it is
			...
		 */
		
		//3. The CLASS WRITER. MUST be called !!!BEFORE!!! ASM Modifications!
		//Lookup the DCASMManager:
		/*
			...
			Notifier.notifyCustomMod("DummyCoreASM", "Class "+name+" has given the next interfaces to check: "+Arrays.asList(checkedClss));
			ClassWriter cw = new ClassWriter(ClassWriter.COMPUTE_MAXS); <---- Here it is
			...
		 */
		//The class CAN be analyzed BEFORE calling a WRITER. However, you MUST initialize one BEFORE ASM Modifications!
		
		//4. Class ADAPTERS(event FILTERS). No such thing for DCASMManager.
		
		//Using CORE ASM is done with a specific USE ORDER:
		//1. Creating a class READER, event READER, analyzer, WRITER, etc.
		//2. Injecting BYTECODE and CHANGING it using the ADAPTERS.
		//3. Giving the BYTECODE back to the JVM

		//ASM is based upon modifying SINGLE class feature AT A TIME.
		//ClassVisitor is what is used to do that.
		//Every method there has something to do with the corresponding CLASS file structure piece(look above)
		//Simple object can be accessed without something special.
		//More complex need to be VISITED, and that returns a specific VISITOR to modify THAT EXACT feature.
		//Modifying an annotation takes ClassVisitor.visitAnnotation, which returns a specific AnnotationVisitor!
		
		//ASM key modification things are:
		//ClassReader = Transforms the bytecode array into EVENTS.
		//ClassWriter = Transforms the EVENTS into bytecode array.
		//ClassAdapter = Filters EVENTS for the ClassWriter.
